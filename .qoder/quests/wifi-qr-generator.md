# WiFi QR Code Generator Application Design

## 1. Overview

The WiFi QR Code Generator is a simple application that allows users to generate QR codes containing WiFi network credentials. When scanned with a mobile device, these QR codes will automatically connect the device to the specified WiFi network without manually entering the password.

### 1.1 Purpose
Create a user-friendly application that simplifies WiFi network sharing by encoding network credentials in a scannable QR code format.

### 1.2 Key Features
- Generate QR codes containing WiFi SSID and password
- Support for different WiFi security types (WPA, WEP, Open)
- Simple user interface for entering network details
- QR code display for easy mobile scanning

## 2. Technology Stack & Dependencies

### 2.1 Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: React.js or Vue.js for web interface
- **QR Code Generation**: JavaScript library such as `qrcode.js` or `qrious`
- **Styling**: CSS3 or styling framework like Tailwind CSS
- **Deployment**: Static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)

### 2.2 Potential Libraries
- `qrcode`: JavaScript library for generating QR codes
- `react-qr-code`: React component for QR code generation
- `qrious`: Pure JavaScript library for QR code generation

## 3. Application Architecture

### 3.1 Component Structure
```
App
├── WiFiForm
│   ├── SSIDInput
│   ├── PasswordInput
│   ├── SecurityTypeSelector
│   └── GenerateButton
├── QRDisplay
│   └── QRCode
└── Instructions
```

### 3.2 Data Flow
1. User enters WiFi credentials (SSID, password, security type)
2. Application formats credentials according to WiFi QR code specification
3. QR code is generated from formatted data
4. QR code is displayed for mobile scanning

## 4. QR Code Format Specification

### 4.1 WiFi QR Code Format
The application will generate QR codes using the standardized WiFi QR code format:
```
WIFI:T:<security_type>;S:<ssid>;P:<password>;
```

### 4.2 Parameters
- `T`: Security type (WPA, WEP, nopass)
- `S`: Network SSID
- `P`: Network password
- `H`: Hidden network flag (true/false, optional)

### 4.3 Examples
```
WIFI:T:WPA;S:MyNetwork;P:MyPassword;;
WIFI:T:WEP;S:OldNetwork;P:WepKey123;;
WIFI:T:nopass;S:OpenNetwork;P:;;
```

## 5. User Interface Design

### 5.1 Input Form
- SSID input field (text)
- Password input field (password type with visibility toggle)
- Security type selector (dropdown: WPA/WPA2, WEP, Open)
- Hidden network toggle (checkbox)
- Generate QR Code button

### 5.2 QR Display Area
- Generated QR code visualization
- Download button for QR code image
- Instructions for mobile scanning

### 5.3 Mobile Scanning Instructions
- Guide users on how to scan QR codes with their mobile devices
- Platform-specific instructions (iOS, Android)

## 6. Security Considerations

### 6.1 Data Handling
- All data processing occurs client-side
- No credentials are stored or transmitted to any server
- Clear form data after QR generation (optional)

### 6.2 Privacy
- No tracking or analytics by default
- Clear privacy policy stating data remains on device

## 7. Implementation Plan

### 7.1 Frontend Components
1. **WiFiForm Component**
   - Manages form state and validation
   - Handles user input for WiFi credentials

2. **QRDisplay Component**
   - Generates and displays QR code
   - Provides download functionality

3. **Instructions Component**
   - Shows scanning instructions
   - Platform-specific guidance

### 7.2 Core Functions
1. Format WiFi credentials according to QR code specification
2. Generate QR code from formatted string
3. Render QR code in UI
4. Provide download functionality

### 7.3 Testing Implementation
1. Configure Jest testing framework with jsdom environment
2. Set up code coverage reporting with Istanbul
3. Implement unit tests for all utility functions
4. Create component tests for React/Vue components
5. Set up continuous integration with coverage requirements
6. Configure coverage thresholds (statements: 100%, branches: 100%, functions: 100%, lines: 100%)
7. Implement test utilities for QR code validation
8. Create mock data for various WiFi network configurations

## 8. Testing Strategy

### 8.1 Unit Tests
- QR code format generation for all security types (WPA, WEP, Open)
- Form validation including edge cases and error handling
- Component rendering with different props and states
- Utility functions for WiFi string formatting with special characters
- QR code generation functions with various input sizes
- Security type validation and error handling
- Hidden network flag handling
- Empty and null input validation
- Special character escaping in SSID and password

### 8.2 Integration Tests
- End-to-end QR code generation flow
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Form submission and QR display
- Download functionality

### 8.3 User Acceptance Testing
- QR code scannability on various devices
- Form usability testing
- Mobile device connectivity verification

### 8.4 Code Coverage
- Target 100% code coverage for all JavaScript/TypeScript files
- Exclude configuration and build files from coverage metrics
- Use Jest with Istanbul for coverage reporting
- Enforce 100% coverage threshold in CI/CD pipeline
- Generate detailed coverage reports for each pull request
- Track coverage separately for unit and integration tests
- Fail builds that do not meet coverage requirements
- Provide coverage badges for documentation

### 8.5 Test File Organization
- Unit tests colocated with implementation files (e.g., `wifiFormatter.test.js` alongside `wifiFormatter.js`)
- Component tests in `__tests__` directories
- Test utilities in `/test-utils` directory
- Mock data fixtures in `/__mocks__` directory
